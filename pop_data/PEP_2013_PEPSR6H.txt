Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States, States, and Counties: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions.
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be of any race.
Responses of "Some Other Race" from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences
between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in
this table versus those in the original 2010 Census data. For more information, see
